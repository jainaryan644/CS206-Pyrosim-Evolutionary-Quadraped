# CS206-Pyrosim-Evolutionary-Quadruped

# In this project I followed the Ludobots Evolutionary Robotics MOOC course. I programmed neurons, synapses, touch sensors, light sensors, and position sensors. 

# I also implemented a variety of algorithms including the genetic Algorithm, parallel hill climber optimization, and evolutionary algorithms.

# With the random function, I was able to form populations of individuals of which only the ones with the highest fitness( measured based on how they move towards the light box ) would produce children.
